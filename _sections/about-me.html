<p>I'm currently pursuing a PhD in comparative psycholinguistics. 
  I'm interested in how langauge is produced and understood, equally from a computational and a neurological level.</p>

<p>I'm curious by nature. I love traveling, living in different countries, learning random geography facts, playing basketball and watching college football.</p>
