<p> Recently I have focused my time doing research on low-resourced languages that are typologically different from the most common spoken languages. 
  In particular, I've been doing experimental work to collect eye tracking and EEG data and analyze it in a Bayesian framework.</p>
<p>The language you speak affects how you perceive the world around you.</p>
<p>For instance, speakers of ergative languages spend less time looking at agents and more time looking at the overall picture to faster grasp the action.</p>
<p>Moreover, these language-based differences in perception are also appreciated in the brain activity, with some languages needing a stronger activation of the neuronal population.</p>
